Math.trump
===

Make math great again: unlock the _real_ number behind the number that the crooked media wants you to believe.

Usage
---

`npm install math.trump`

Programatically on the browser or server:

```javascript
require('math.trump')

// we extend built-ins because we don't want to
// outsource to some foreign module
// what could go wrong?
Math.trump(250000)
// 940856
```

Via the CLI:

```shell
$ npm i -g math.trump
$ trumpmath 25000
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸  753720 ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
```

Why????

The current U.S. Administration has taught us that facts (or "truth") can have [alternatives](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/). This module aims to make it as easy as possible to generate and proliferate these non-deterministic alternative interpretations of reality on both the server and the client.
