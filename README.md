Math.trump
===

Make math great again: The current U.S. Administration has taught us that facts (or "truth") can have alternatives. This module aims to make it as easy as possible to generate and proliferate these non-deterministic alternative interpretations of reality on the server and the client.

Usage
---

`npm install math.trump`

Programatically on the browser or server:

```javascript
require('math.trump')

// we extend built-ins because we don't want to
// outsource to some foreign module
// what could go wrong?
Math.trump(250000)
// 940856
```

Via the CLI:

```shell
$ npm i -g math.trump
$ trumpmath 25000

```
